#  Project Description: PLI, Grad-CAM, and VGG19
#  This project focuses on enhancing interpretability in AI-driven medical diagnostics, particularly for pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images. It leverages deep learning techniques and interpretability methods to provide visual explanations of model predictions. The primary components of this project are:

1. Pixel-Level Interpretability (PLI)
PLI is a fine-grained interpretability method designed to highlight the importance of each pixel in an image concerning the model's prediction. By attributing relevance scores at the pixel level, PLI provides highly detailed heatmaps that allow clinicians to understand exactly which regions of an X-ray contributed to the diagnostic outcome. This method is particularly valuable in medical imaging, where precise localization of abnormalities is critical.

2. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)
Grad-CAM is a widely-used interpretability technique that generates class-discriminative heatmaps, highlighting the regions of an image that are most influential in the model's decision-making process. Unlike PLI, Grad-CAM produces more general heatmaps that capture broader feature areas, making it suitable for identifying larger regions of interest in X-ray images.

3. VGG19 Model
VGG19, a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture pre-trained on ImageNet, serves as the backbone of the pneumonia classification model. VGG19 is known for its depth and simplicity, making it effective for extracting complex features from medical images. The model is fine-tuned to classify chest X-ray images as either pneumonia-positive or normal.

Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Chest X-ray images are resized, normalized, and augmented to ensure robustness.
Model Training: The VGG19 model is trained on pneumonia and normal datasets, optimizing for accuracy and generalization.
Interpretability Generation: After training, PLI and Grad-CAM are applied to generate heatmaps for a given query X-ray image.
Visualization: The generated heatmaps are overlaid on the original image to provide visual explanations of the model's decision-making process.
Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to enhance the interpretability of AI models in medical imaging, ensuring that predictions can be understood and trusted by healthcare professionals. By comparing PLI and Grad-CAM, this study aims to determine which method provides more clinically relevant explanations, ultimately contributing to safer and more transparent AI-assisted diagnostics.
